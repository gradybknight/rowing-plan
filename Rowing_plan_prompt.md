# Rowing plan for 47 year old single sculler

## Objective

- build high level annual plan for a 47 year old master rower
- Describe macro cycles
- Focus on "peaking" in the fall for head races in 2026 (approximately 5,000m)
- Start the training plan on 03-Nov-2025

## Rower's constraints

- December, January, and February are cold weather months. It will be unpredictable whether he can get to row on the water
- The rower has access to the following equipment:
  - Single scull without a power meter. It has a pace meter and the ability to measure heart rate and stroke rate
  - Water Rower for indoor sessions. This has pace, power, and heart rate
  - Tonal weight machine (effectively a cable machine)

## Goals (in ranked order)

- Build speed on the water in a single scull, targeting fall 2026 head races
- Increase strength using the tonal weight system. This should focus on rowing specific strength but also include "vanity" lifts as the athlete would like to increase chest and shoulder size

## Plan constraints

- The lake is closed on Mondays in October, November, December, January, February, and March. No on the water sessions can occur on these days
- The weather is variable here, often having too much wind to safely scull on the lake. An alternative workout should be provided if the lake is not accessible
- On the water sessions should last no more than one hour excluding warmup. Do not probram a warmup
- On the water sessions are in the morning
- Use the karvonen method for determining heart rate zones. This should be reassessed periodically
- water rower sessions should take advantage of the power meter

## Current State

- The athlete is currently _targeting_ six on the water sessions weekly (generally taking Sunday off). Occasionally something comes up which prevents the athlete from completing a session. He generally drops the workout day or replaces the session with a UT2 water rower session
