C2 static watts vs NK Empower Oarlock watts – A personal comparison
Posted on 01/03/2017 by stelph82
Just a short post on some findings using the Empower Oarlock – I am working on a review and I promise I will try and get it out as soon as possible! In testing the gate I had been wanting to compare two equivalent workouts on a concept 2 ergo and the water to see whether it is possible to use the information on one to use the other – for example if you have set training wattages on the erg, could you use the same wattages on the water? To test this I decided to run a common FTP test to see how each compares to the other.

For those of you that aren’t aware of FTP (functional threshold Power) – it is basically an invented value that is described as the power that you are able to hold for an hour, and is closely correlated to a 4mmol blood lactate level (read about lactate testing here) but as it doesn’t require the costly blood testing method so is a cheap way of getting a similar result and to then be able to set training zones.

A workout for an hour flat out doesn’t sound like much fun however, and so in cycling it is common to run a 20” test and to then use 95% of the power for your FTP – rowing however is slightly different, I don’t know about you but I know my 6K score and my hour score are not 95% of each other! More commonly its around 80-85% and so one recommendation is to do a 20” at rate 20 and use 100% of that value to get your FTP.

Below is the table which shows the outcome of the two tests

As you can see I averaged 30 watts more on the water than on the erg which I wasn’t expecting – the conditions for the water workout were challenging (head wind and chop) so I thought I would see an impact on power with me battling the conditions as well as the workout, also interestingly other users of the Empower gate are seeing lower values on the water than they are seeing on the erg

As a side note the difference in wattage between on the water and on the erg that I am seeing is a similar value to the difference I used to see when I was comparing rowperfect and static ergo scores – so using lactate testing an sticking to 2mmol I would see 20-30 watts more on the dynamic than the static

Conclusion

It is too early to conclude what this means as of yet – just from my data and Rod Siegal’s it does seem to suggest that the comparability between the empower watts and ergo watts varies person to person so you can’t use training zones set on the erg on the water (and vice versa), it would be recommended to run the tests on both to work them out.

EDIT: another thing to add is that as I am sculling and the NK is recording one side power only (bow side in my case) and then doubling it then this could be skewing the results I favour if the water session – i.e. If I am putting more power out on bowside then I could be getting a false high result for the overall

My previous experiences do seem to suggest that the rowperfect may be a better tool for hitting the same watts as you would see on the water. Of course the only way to test this is to repeat the 20 min test on the rowperfect….. great….
