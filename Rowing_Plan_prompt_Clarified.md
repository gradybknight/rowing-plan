# Annual Rowing Training Plan Request

## Context

Generate a comprehensive 12-month periodized training plan for a master rower targeting head race performance. The plan should incorporate evidence-based training principles for endurance athletes while accounting for equipment limitations and weather constraints.

## Athlete Profile

- **Age:** 47 years old
- **Discipline:** Single sculling
- **Experience Level:** Competed at the national level in high school and college in both sweep and sculling. Was unable to row for ~10 years but has been consistently sculling for the last three years

### Current Physiological Data

- **Resting HR:** 56 bpm
- **Maximum HR:** 178 bpm
- **Current 2000m time:** [Please provide for baseline fitness assessment]

## Training Objectives

### Primary Goal
Peak for fall 2026 head races (approximately 5000m distance) with optimal speed and endurance capacity in single scull.

### Secondary Goals
- Develop rowing-specific strength and power
- Increase upper body muscle mass (chest/shoulders)
- Maintain year-round fitness despite seasonal constraints

## Periodization Framework

- **Plan Duration:** November 3, 2025 - October 31, 2026
- **Target Competition Window:** September-October 2026
- **Macrocycle Structure:** Base phase → Build phases → Competition phase → Recovery

## Equipment and Training Environment

### Available Equipment
- **Single scull:** Pace meter, heart rate monitor, stroke rate display (no power meter)
- **WaterRower:** Pace, power output, and heart rate capabilities
- **Tonal system:** Cable-based resistance training with digital load tracking

### Environmental Constraints
- **Lake closure:** Mondays during Oct-Mar (no water sessions possible)
- **Weather risk:** High wind frequency requires backup indoor alternatives for each water session
- **Winter months:** Dec-Feb present unpredictable water access
- **Session duration:** Water sessions limited to 60 minutes maximum (excluding warm-up)
- **Timing:** Water sessions occur in morning hours

## Current Training Status

**Weekly Structure:** 6 sessions (Sunday typically off)

### Current Weekly Plan
- **Monday:** 12×1' intervals @ R34-36
- **Tuesday:** 6×3' VO₂max @ R30-32
- **Wednesday:** 60' UT2 @ R18-20
- **Thursday:** 60' UT2 @ R18-20
- **Friday:** 3×8' race pace @ R26-28
- **Saturday:** 75' UT2 @ R18-20
- **Sunday:** Rest or easy UT2 @ R18-20

## Required Plan Components

### Training Zone Specifications
- Calculate heart rate zones using Karvonen method (HRmax 178, RHR 56)
- Define power zones for WaterRower sessions
- Specify stroke rate ranges for each training intensity
- Include periodic zone reassessment protocols

### Session Programming Requirements
- **Water sessions:** Include primary workout and weather-alternative indoor equivalent
- **Strength training:** Rowing-specific exercises plus hypertrophy work for chest/shoulders
- **Recovery protocols:** Active recovery and complete rest recommendations
- **Progression schemes:** How to advance training loads throughout macrocycles

### Plan Structure Deliverables
- Monthly mesocycle objectives and focus areas
- Weekly microcycle templates for each training phase
- Specific workout prescriptions with intensity, duration, and stroke rate
- Alternative indoor sessions for each water workout
- Strength training periodization aligned with rowing phases
- Taper strategy for competition preparation

### Monitoring and Adjustment
- Key performance indicators to track progress
- Testing protocols (time trials, benchmarks)
- Decision trees for modifying sessions based on weather/availability
- Load management strategies for 47-year-old athlete

### Additional Considerations
- Account for master athlete recovery needs
- Include injury prevention strategies
- Specify when to prioritize technique vs. fitness development
- Address motivation and adherence strategies for year-long plan

Please provide a detailed, implementable training plan that addresses all specified requirements while demonstrating understanding of rowing-specific training principles and master athlete considerations.
